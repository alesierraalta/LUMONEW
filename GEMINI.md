use MCP tools in every message, if you dont, its a bad response
ALWAYS propose: whats next? and the put the nexts steps

When performing any type of testing that involves creating, modifying, inserting, updating, or deleting data in the database, you must implement proper test data cleanup and rollback procedures to restore the database to its exact original state. This includes removing all test records, reverting any modifications to existing data, resetting auto-increment values, clearing temporary tables, and ensuring no trace of test data remains in the production or development database environment. Implement database transactions with rollback capabilities, use test-specific database schemas, or create comprehensive cleanup scripts that execute automatically after test completion to maintain data integrity and prevent test data pollution.

to test use:

powershell -Command Invoke-WebRequest


while less code you use to optimize the app and the scalability better without lose funcionality

First, invoke the MCP framework in this exact order for memory improvement and context setup:
1. `sequentialThinking`
3. `servers`
6. `contex7`
6. `deeplucid`

Efficiency Guidelines:
- Only call each MCP tool when its output is strictly needed.  
- Group related calls into a single batch where possible.  
- Reuse cached or recent results from `memoryBank` to avoid redundant calls.  
- Document the purpose and expected output of each tool invocation.  
- Measure and log execution time for each step to identify bottlenecks.

Then:
1. Read every attached user file to fully understand the error or request.  
2. Craft your response step by step, in clear English.  
3. When code is needed, always include the complete, simplest, most efficient example.  
4. At the end of your response:
   - List the MCP tools you used (with a brief rationale).  
   - Summarize the changes made.  
   - Explain the next steps the user should take.  
   - Note any performance observations or optimizations for future requests.

Be super direct and follow each step exactly.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
