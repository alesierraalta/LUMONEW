# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The authentication system is experiencing timeout issues where users see "Auth state change: SIGNED_IN" messages followed by "Auth loading timeout - forcing completion" errors. This creates a poor user experience and indicates race conditions in the authentication flow. The system needs to be fixed to provide reliable authentication state management without timeouts or loading issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to load quickly and reliably, so that I can access the application without timeout errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the application THEN the authentication state SHALL be determined within 3 seconds
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the loading state SHALL be cleared immediately
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN a clear error message SHALL be displayed without timeout warnings
4. WHEN the authentication service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent authentication state management, so that I don't see duplicate or conflicting auth state messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state changes THEN only one state change event SHALL be logged per actual change
2. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL not trigger unnecessary re-authentication
3. WHEN initial auth data is provided THEN the system SHALL use it without additional verification calls
4. WHEN auth state is determined THEN loading SHALL be set to false immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling in the authentication flow, so that I can debug issues and provide better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase client initialization fails THEN the error SHALL be logged and handled gracefully
2. WHEN authentication verification fails THEN the user SHALL be signed out cleanly
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to handle server-side and client-side synchronization properly, so that my auth state is consistent across page loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server-side auth data is available THEN it SHALL be used as the initial state
2. WHEN client-side auth state differs from server-side THEN server-side SHALL take precedence
3. WHEN auth state changes THEN both client and server state SHALL be synchronized
4. WHEN page is refreshed THEN authentication state SHALL be maintained without re-authentication
